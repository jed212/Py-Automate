B09G9FPHY6,"This Apple 🍎 iPad 9th generation is very competent and does everything I want it to do.  I don’t do anything really super complicated with it (mostly streaming 🎥 movies, surfing 🏄‍♂️ the net, and of course, ✍️ writing product reviews 🤪😁😜😛😆) so it’s fine for my needs.  Without a case, it’s just over a pound (so not that heavy).  It has fast connectivity and is intuitively, user-friendly.  The 👁️ retina display touchscreen is a pretty decent size at 10.2 inches (diagonally).  The touchscreen is sharp, vivid, true to color, and very responsive.  Also, this iPad came with a 20W USB-C power adapter, USB-C to lightning charge cable, and 3 months free Apple TV+.  The Apple TV+ is great because I have been able to watch the ⚽️ soccer/football⚽️ show, Ted Lasso, for FREE.  👍😁👍  Score!!!!!  ⚽️🥅⚽️  Apple 🍏 makes excellent, quality electronics, and this handheld computer is absolutely no exception.  👍🍏😃🍎  The only things I wish were different about this iPad are the slow charging speed and the battery drains a little faster than I would like.  I use the iPad while it’s charging and that slows down the charging speed.  I purchased this iPad for about $200 plus tax (free shipping, on sale, and had a gift card too).  I would like to buy the 10th generation iPad, but it’s just too pricey and expensive for me.  This is a much more budget-friendly option.  Long story short, I really like this iPad and am very happy with this purchase.  Because of its excellent qualities, it’s going to be very useful to me, and I think 🤔 it will last a long time.  I am impressed by it and highly recommend it (especially if money is a factor).  👍🍏🤪❤️😃🍎👍🍏😎🤔🍏👍❤️😝⭐️🩷🍎👍",🍎 Excellent Quality 🍏 Value 🍎 Sharp Retina Display 🍏 User Friendly 🍎🤪🍏❤️😃😎❤️🍏,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2023",True,5.0
B09G9FPHY6,"For over a decade, I thought anyone who spent the money on an iPad was an idiot.  I bought one Android tablet after another because they were cheap and ""just as good"".  But each one didn't last long before running so slow I had to replace it.  Meanwhile, my old iPhone 5 was still working great as a music and sleep machine audio device for our bedroom.  I finally decided to step up to THIS iPad back in 2021.  WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG!!!!!!  First, it is still blazingly fast and will be for basic tasks like I use it for a decade or more.  I won't have to replace this for a very very long time.  Second.....the user experience is incredible, just like an iPhone or Macbook.  I'm cheap, but wish I hadn't tried to save money buying all those garbage low end Android tablets over the years.",SOOOOOO much better than cheap Android tablets,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023",True,5.0
B09G9FPHY6,"It is a new iPad, in an unopened box. Would not expect it to be anything other than great Apple quality, which it is. My ONLY complaint with this order is that it took about 2 weeks to be delivered rather than a couple of days. I’m sure that has something to do with logistics and how Amazon buys stock and sells genuine Apple new (rather than “refreshed”) electronics and there was no huge rush, just a disconnect between the usual Amazon speed of fulfillment and the experience with this purchase. Nevertheless, the savings made it all worth it. And I love my new iPad.","Better than Apple, because it was less expensive than Apple","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2023",True,5.0
B09G9FPHY6,I use my iPad all the time since I don’t have a computer. My old one was at least six years old and the battery was pretty much gone and I had to keep it plugged in all the time to be able to use it. I had been putting off replacing it but decided the time and price were right. It’s easy to set up a replacement because all my stuff is in my Icloud account. I highly recommend getting this model next time it’s on special. Apple has some great deals when newer models are released.,Love my new iPad and got it at a great price on Prime Sale Day,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023",True,5.0

B09G9FPHY6,"My old Ipad Pro hasn’t worked for over a year and I also needed a new computer -  but didn’t need anything as sophisticated as a Mac so thought I would try out this 9th Gen Ipad.  So far it does most of what I would do with a larger laptop and has a touchscreen.  I was reluctant to buy Apple tech for quite a few years until I bought a small Iphone SE about 4 years ago - switched from a Samsung Galaxy..  The SE was a great size to carry around the city and it fit in most pockets and had great reception.  It was and still is a great piece of technology.  I upgraded to a 12 after 2 years and still use the SE around the house because it connects to wifi.  The 12 had a better camera and I had toddler granddaughters and after another 2 years I upgraded to the 14 PROMax which has a great camera, larger screen and is not unlike the SE except the bigger size to view photos.  I really love the touchscreen feature for NYTimes games and other interactive apps.  I worry about having most of my pictures on this technology because they could move to a more sophisticated system and make these obsolete - which is a concern. My daughter’s Iphone 13 fell in the snow a few years ago and she somehow lost all her pictures that she thought were in the cloud.  I held on to my 12 because it holds quite a bit of what she lost since we shared their photos.  Neither of us is sure why this happened and if it could happen again.  If I have a stand alone camera it isn’t convenient but I have the photos detached from the technology and the whims of a large multinational behemoth.  So far I am happy with the Ipad and am still learning how to use it.  I found a case that closes securely and  can stand in portrait or landscape mode which is really nice when viewing Netflix or AppleTV.  If you need a new computer to carry conveniently this Ipad is the way to go unless you really need the power and graphic abilities of the MAC.  My Iphone 14maxpro has 256g of memory and I barely use 100 so I thought I would only need 64g on the Ipad since my phone has the extra capacity.  Not convinced this was a great decision but some of my Iphone content can stay there exclusively  so it might just work out.  Or not…..",Nice IPad.  Larger than I thought it would be but easy to carry in a bag,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2023",True,5.0
B09G9FPHY6,I believe we bought this either on a Prime day sale or Black Friday sale for around $250. It was an old model for sure but it has been working out perfectly for my 8yo who received it for Christmas last year right before she turned 8! It was such a reasonable price and she was starting to outgrow the fire kids tablets we had purchased when she was between the ages of 2 and 7 yo.,Perfect!!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023",True,5.0
B09G9FPHY6,"I got this for my wife who loves to watch her media content, surf the web and play her occasional game. She loves the display and the battery longevity compared to her 2 android tablets. She also uses the iPad from time to time to take notes and to doodle and has had no complaints. All in all this tablet is more than powerful enough for what she and most iPad owners do. The display is beautiful, the sound is adequate andit has all the connectivity she needs. All in all a great Apple product that is now part of her commute bag.Hope this was helpful!",Great content consumer and all the iPad most need.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023",True,5.0
